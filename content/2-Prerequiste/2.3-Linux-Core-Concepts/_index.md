### Linux Kernel

**If you have worked with any operating system, you have run into the term kernel.**

![Createacloud](/images/2-Prerequiste/3/1.PNG)

- The Linux kernel is monolithic, this means that the kernel carrries out CPU scheduling, memory management and several operations by itselfs.

- The Linux Kernel is also modular, which means it can extends its capabilities through the use of dynamically loaded kernel modules

**To understand a kernel in simple terms, let us use an analogy of a ``College Library``. Here the librarian is equal to Linux Kernel.**

**The Kernel is responsible for 4 major tasks**
- Memory Management
- Process Management
- Device Drivers
- System calls and Security

### Linux Kernel Versions
![Createacloud](/images/2-Prerequiste/3/3.png)

**let us know identify the ways to identify linux kernel versions**

1. Use uname command to get the information about the kernel (by itself it doesn't provide much information except that the system uses the Linux Kernel.

```
$ uname
```

2. Use the uname -r or uname comamnd and option to print the kernel version

```
$ uname -r
$ uname -a
```

### Kernel and User Space
![Createacloud](/images/2-Prerequiste/3/4.PNG)

**One of the important functions of the linux kernel is the ``Memory Management`` . We will now see how memory is seperated within the linux kernel** .

Memory is divded into two areas:

    Kernel Space
        Kernel Code
        kernel Extensions
        Device Drivers
    User Space
        C
        Java
        Python
        Ruby e.t.c
        Docker Containers


### How programs running in the User Space work

All user programs function by manipulating data that is stored in memory and on disk. User programs get access to data by making special request to the kernel called ``System Calls``

- Examples include, allocating memory by using variables or opening a file.

- For example, opening a file such as the `/etc/os-release` to see the operating system installed, results in a system call

### Lab - Linux Kernel

3. To check the exact kernel version that is running in this system.

```
$ uname -r
```

4. what is the kernel version in 4.15.0-88-generic?

```
Look for the first digit. In this case, it is 15
```

5. What is the major version number of the kernel 4.15.0-88-generic

```
Look for the second digit after the kernel version separated by a . In this case, it is 15
```

6. Which command would you run to print the messages generated by the kernel?

```
Type the command dmesg to see the messages.
$ dmesg
```

7. To list/count all block devices of type disk that are present in the system

```
Run: lsblk and count the number of disk devices.
$ lsblk
```

8. To check total number of physical cores in the system.

```
Run lscpu and multiply the Core(s) per socket with the number of Socket(s):
$ lscpu
```

9. To check total online memory

```
Run the lsmem command and look for the value of online memory
$ lsmem
```

### File Type in Linux
![Createacloud](/images/2-Prerequiste/3/7.png)

10. One way to identify a file type is by making use of the file command.

```
$ file /home/michael
$ file bash-script.sh
$ file insync1000.sock
$ file /home/michael/bash-script
```

11. Another way to identify a file type is by making use of the ls -ld command
![Createacloud](/images/2-Prerequiste/3/8.png)

```
ls -ld /home/michael
ls -l basg-script.sh
```

### Filesystem Hierarchy
![Createacloud](/images/2-Prerequiste/3/9.png)


Linux uses single rooted, inverted tree like file system

- `/home` : It is the location that contains the home directories for all users, except the root user (root user home directory is located at /root)

- `/opt` : If you want to install any third party programs put them in the /opt filesystem.

- `/mnt` : It is the default mount point for any partition and it is empty by default. It is used to mount filesystems temporarly in the system

- `/tmp` : It is used to store temporary data

- `/media` : All external media is mounted on /media

- `/dev` : Contains the special block and character device files

- `/bin` : The basic programs such as binaries cp, mv, mkdir are located in the /bin directory

- `/etc` : It stores most of the configuration files in Linux.

- `/lib` : The directory /lib and /lib64 is the place to look for shared libraries to be imported into your program

- `/usr` : In older systems, /usr directory is used for User Home Directories, however in the modern linux operating systems it is the location where all user land applciations in their data reside

- `/var` : It contains variable data like mails, log files

To print all the mounted filesystems, run `df` (disk filesystem) command

```
$ df -hP
```
